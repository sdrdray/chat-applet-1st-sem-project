## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application with SocketIO and message handling  
├── enc_decr.ipynb          # Jupyter notebook for encryption/decryption examples  
├── key.py                  # File potentially containing the AES key (though key is in app.py)  
├── server.py               # File potentially for server setup or related logic  
└── templates/  
    └── index.html          # HTML file for the client-side interface  
```

## ✨ Features

* 🔁 Real-time messaging using WebSockets
* 🔒 AES encryption and decryption of messages
* 🧑‍💻 Client-specific rooms for message routing

---

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

* **Backend:** Python with Flask and Flask-SocketIO
* **Encryption:** AES using the `PyCryptodome` library
* **Frontend:** HTML and JavaScript (served from `index.html`)
